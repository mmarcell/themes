        Some people are not comfortable in front of the camera, especially I've found, men.

        So this is for you men who your mothers, girlfriends, wives have forced to book this session against your will.

        <b>I am not evil.</b> I understand you may not want to be there in the beginning. My request is that you leave any preconceived notions at home. You may surprise yourself by even.... smiling... <b>or laughing!</b>
        <hr width="30%";>
        Pretend like this is a normal date, or family outing. You don't even have to always look at the camera! Kiss the girl, snuggle her neck.. Those moments are just as special, and she'll appreciate it. <b>Be yourself!</b>
        <hr width="30%";>
        I'm pretty relaxed, you'll see that right away. If you have an idea let me know! And your family will be impressed that you came up with something great!
        <hr width="30%";>
        <b>Don't come hungry.</b> I don't care what anyone says.. You feed yourself before you come. Bring a snack if you need to.
        <hr width="30%";>
        <b>It's only an hour!</b> Just keep telling yourself. I know you hate it, and they know you hate it, and you know you hate it. I promise if you relax and enjoy yourself, it will be over before you know it. And you may not even dread your next session!

        <b>(Yes we want pictures of you.. Yearly even)</b>
