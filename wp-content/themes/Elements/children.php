            Having your family photos taken does not need to feel like a chore that you dread every year.

            Here are a few tips that I have gathered from experience to help your session be more stress free:
            </div>
            <hr width="70%";>
            <div id="c-leader">
            <h3>1.</h3> Feed them... And bring snacks. Nothing worse than a hungry kiddo.
            <hr width="30%";>
            <h3>2.</h3> Bring a jacket, or wear layers. San Diego has mild weather year round, which is wonderful for outdoor sessions. However, most will take place in the early morning, or the hours just before sunset, and these are the coldest times. By the way.. the beach is windy. When planning those amazing outfits, please take this into account.
            <hr width="30%";>
            <h3>3.</h3> Bring binky... Or bobo or nunu or whatever your baby's special lovey is called. We may not always like the stinky blanky that they won't let us wash, or the stuffed animal that doesn't match a thing on their outfit, but if it makes them happy, by all means make them happy. We're capturing a moment in your child's life, and binky has a very special place in that little life. Next years pictures may not include a blanky anymore, and you'll look back on those snuggle pictures for a lifetime.
            <hr width="30%";>
            <h3>4.</h3> PLAY! There is this age... Between 1-4 when your child may become completely horrid in front of the camera. Relax. I had three of those. Its normal. If you have a photogenic 2 year old, the rest of us are jealous. The best thing you can do is accept it and have fun! Tickle fights and wrestling matches are much more fun than a fussy 3 year old who doesn't want to "cheese" for the camera.
            <hr width="30%";>
            <h3>5.</h3> Most importantly, try not to get aggravated at them, I truly have been through this personally. You just keep smiling and let me worry about the rest.
