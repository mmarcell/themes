            Potential clients often ask about locations for their photo shoot, so I have compiled a list of the basic settings and what I personally like and dislike about each location. I do not have a true preference for any of the locations, I love shooting everywhere and will deal with all of the "cons" plus some to get great shots.

                    <b>Beach:</b> My favorite beaches are imperial beach and pacific beach. Both have piers, and grassy areas that can mix up the background of the standard beach shoot.

                            <b>Cons:</b> Children love sand (or hate it) it's usually chilly, often crowded, the sun is bright, you may get wet, there are often bugs. Parking is horrible.
