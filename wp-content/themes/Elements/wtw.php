        I get many questions before a session and one of the most common is, "what should we wear?"
        </div>
        <div id="subleader">
        So I've put together some tips, and examples:

        <div id="c-leader">
        <h3>1.</h3><b>Layer!</b> One of my most important tips. We will most likely be shooting early in the morning, or in the hours just before sunset. These times can be cold, and windy. Please be prepared.
        <hr width="30%";>
        <h3>2.</h3><b>Don't feel like you need everyone to match.</b> It has been very popular in the past for everyone to match perfectly. I actually discourage this, because, well, we're all individuals. Wearing the same outfits can cause everyone to blend a little too much.
        <hr width="30%";>
        <h3>3.</h3><b>Color is fun!</b> It's great when everyone wears outfits in the same color families.. For example, everyone in neutrals, or brights. Mix it up with one or two people in patterns, that coordinate in some way.
        <hr width="30%";>
        <h3>4.</h3><b>Accessorize!</b> Purses, hats, headbands can be a great way to bring in a touch of color and tie in with a color scheme.
        <hr width="30%";>
        <h3>5.</h3><b>Hats...</b> Special note for hats. Do not wear a hat to your session unless you plan on leaving it on the ENTIRE time. Hat hair and lines on your forehead are not your best features.
