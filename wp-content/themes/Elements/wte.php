            Generally I go straight home and upload your pictures into my editing software.
            Usually I'm so excited about your pictures that I look at them at red lights on the way home.
            If I'm lucky, my kids will cooperate long enough for me to get 2-4 sneak peeks up on Facebook for you to tag and share.

            Late that night after everyone is in bed, I'll sneak into my office and begin the culling process.
            I remove all of the photos where you're blinking or a bit blurry, or the angle just isn't appealing.
            I correct any obvious lighting or color issues and head to bed. The next day I crop, and do my fine editing.
            I may put special effects on your pictures, change some to black and white and adjust the contrast of each on individually.
            I then start the meticulous process of brightening your jewelry, smoothing your skin.
            Taking care of any obvious blemishes. I brighten your eyes and whiten your teeth.
            I increase contrast and saturation on tattoos, because I like tattoos.
            (If you have any small ones you'd like to erase let me know ahead of time)
            I erase random people that walk through your background and curse them silently.

            If all goes well, I can do this in one sitting... If not, (more common) we're on to day three.
            I really prefer to look at your pictures at least two days.
            The second day, my eyes are rested and fresh and I will catch things I didn't before.
            I'll sharpen and remove any extra pink from your skin and finally export everything back to the hard drive.
            Then it's on to the website!
            I create your gallery, link, and password as well as assign price lists and coupon codes.
            I can then upload your photos and share the link with you. So in this example, I only had your session to work on.
            It took three days from shoot to published photos. This can be shorter or longer (up to a week for standard sessions, 2 weeks for events) depending on my work load, and family demands.
            But in the end I have poured my effort into making your photos the best I can, and I hope that it shows.
